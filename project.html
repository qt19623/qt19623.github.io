<h2>Can reduced meat consumption trend today generate considerable environmental impact?</h2>
  <h2>Introduction and aims</h2>
  <!--Chart 1 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart1">

      var myChart1 = "project/project1worldghgemission.json";

	<p> Greenhouse gas emission from agricultural sector has grown over time, worsening environmental problem. Research suggests that this is <a class="textLink" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216"> 26%</a> of total greenhouse gas emission. This implies that if we can change our diet in more environmentally friendly way, we may be able to improve environmental problems significantly. This research aims to analyse how diet of people in the UK has changed, and whether this reduced negative impact on environment. The research will particularly focus on meat consumption, as it produces about a half of total agricultural sector emission and has the biggest potential for reduction with high emission per kilogram. </p> 
		    </div>

  <h2>Motivation for change</h2>
       <!--Chart 2 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart2">
    <script>
      var myChart2 = "project/project2changeindiet.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart2', myChart2);
    </script>
</div>
  
  <!--Chart 3 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart3">
    <script>
      var myChart3 = "project/project3attempts.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart3', myChart3);
    </script>
</div>
<p>According to the survey, about a half of population in the UK has attempted to change their diet to improve health or sustainability. This attempt involves activities like eating less meat or following diet with no animal products.</p>  
  
  <h2>Has it changed?</h2>
    <!--Chart 4 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart4">
    <script>
      var myChart4 = "project/project4dailymeatintake.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart4', myChart4);
    </script>
</div>
 
	  <div class="wrap">
	<p> Although survey year does not match, data above will show Britonsâ€™ willingness and attempts to change diet. In relation to that, such attempts are reflected on the change in daily meat intake. Overall meat consumption in gram has fallen. There has been gradual drop in consumption of red meat while consumption of white meat has increased slightly. Red meat consumption drop would be due to health concern and environmental impact of red meat, particularly beef with high per kilogram impact. White meat consumption increase would be due to less media exposure of health issues from white meat and lower per kilogram impact compared to red meat. 
<a class="textLink" href="https://theconversation.com/meat-eating-drops-by-17-over-a-decade-in-the-uk-new-research-168626"> White meat consumption increase </a> would be due to less emphasis of health issues from white meat and lower per kilogram impact compared to red meat.</p>

<h2>Environmental impact</h2>
    <!--Chart 5 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart5">
    <script>
      var myChart5 = "project/project5trellisenvironment impact.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart5', myChart5);
    </script>
  </div>
  <p>As a result, individuals in 2019 saved about 0.76kg greenhouse gas, 3m^2 land, and 15.7 litres of fresh water every day on average, compared to people in 2008. This is mainly driven by drop in red meat eating, particularly beef. As per kilogram impact of beef is high, it cancelled out the impact of other meat increase, especially in greenhouse gas emission.</p>
  
  <h2>Further analysis</h2>

      <!--Chart 6 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart6">
    <script>
      var myChart6 = "project/project6developpcbubbleplot.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart6', myChart6);
    </script>
  </div>
  
  <p>
However, not all countries have similar trend as in the UK. If we compare developed and developing countries, we can find similar pattern only appears in developed countries with reduced beef and sheep meat consumption and increased poultry consumption. In contrast, meat consumption in developing countries has risen for all meat types. We can deduce that this is because of different absolute amount consumed as shown in the chart. 
</p>
  <!--Chart 7 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart7">
    <script>
      var myChart7 = "project/project7gdpmeatcorr.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart7', myChart7);
    </script>
  </div>
  <p>Along with phenomenon that people tend to eat more meat as their income rises, data indicates that meat consumption per capita will further rise until these countries reach certain level of income and meat consumption. Therefore, if we view globally, such environmentally friendly change is only limited to some countries. To make considerable difference, we need further measure such as larger reduction per capita or globalisation of such trend.</p>
     <!--Chart 8 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart8">
    <script>
      var myChart8 = "project/project8worldpop.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart8', myChart8);
    </script>
  </div>
  <p>
Besides, world population is expected to rise for next few decades. This will cancel out individual effort in such trend, so we need more saving to make an impact. 
</p>
  
  
 <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
  <p>To conclude, there has been a change in meat consumption of people in the UK, which improved greenhouse gas emission, land use, and water use per capita. This was driven by drop in beef (red meat) consumption, implying change in composition of meat eating can minimize individual impact effectively. However, this is not enough to generate meaningful difference overall due to population increase and other countries with different trends.</p>
  
<h2>Challenges in analysis and how I overcame</h2>
  <p>Project initially planned to show the change in consumption of other food category along with change in meat consumption, such as plant-based meat alternatives. However, data on amount consumed and environmental impact of such diet was split into too many categories. Also, there was no significant difference in environmental impact made by them, as they have relatively low impact per kilogram. Due to that, for simplicity, project focused on meat consumption only. For the same reason, analysis about emission from supply chain, such as packaging and transport, was excluded.</p>

<h2>Rabalder Parken in Roskilde, Denmark</h2>



	<p> Rabalder park is a multipurpose facility which normally serves as a skate park and public leisure space. When there is a huge rain, it can store and drain water equivalent to 10 Olympic swimming pools. Without expensive and inefficient construction of large-scale drainage system</p>

  <h2>The city with permeable spaces</h2>
  <h2>Sponge cities in China</h2>
      
  <p>
In 2015, the sponge city project began in 16 cities and expanded to further14 cities next year. The project aims to prevent floods by securing space and time to drain rainwater on the ground before it reaches the river and dam. To achieve it, they are working on many measures like 
  </p>
    <p>
     Constructing waterways and green space near an urban area 
      </p>
   <p>
    Create wetlands
      </p>
   <p>
   Green roofs
      </p>
   <p>
    Use permeable asphalt  
      </p>
  <p>
  Rainwater contained can be reused. According to the guidelines of the project, 80% of cities will be able to retain and use 70% of rainwater by 2030. This reduces the risk of flood damage, increases water supply in drought, provides green space for leisure to citizens and so on. 
However, compared to the huge budget required to achieve this goal, which is $230 billion by 2030, the central government plans to provide only 1/5 of this which makes local municipalities that couldnâ€™t find private investors suffer.

 <h2>Green roofs</h2> 
  <h2>Multifunctional roofs in Rotterdam</h2>
  <p>It is estimated that Rotterdam has 18.5km2 of flat roofs. From 2008, Rotterdam encouraged to use of these roofs multifunctional, such as green roofs which grow plants, blue roofs for rainwater storage and drainage, yellow roofs to generate sustainable energy and so on. They are aiming to turn 1km2 of roofs to become multifunctional and expect 15 to 25 years to achieve it. 
To encourage private owned roofs (not only municipality-owned), they also provide subsidies and advice.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the building owners who transformed roofs to retain 30ml of rainwater per 1m2 can receive up to $530 per 1000L of water retained.
  </p>
  <p>
    They also held Rooftop Days to increase the engagement and interest of citizens from 2015. 
In 2009, 360,000m2 of roofs were transformed and this can retain 9 million L of rainwater which is equivalent to 4 Olympic swimming pools. Water can be used in drought.

Before the project was implemented, green roofs were tested in Oud Mathenesse near Rotterdam. 25% of roofs that can be used were transformed into green roofs, and annual overflow volume was reduced by 19.5%.

    WAP aims to reduce energy costs and improve health and safety, by supporting low-income families in the United States. WAP retrofit facilities like insulation, heating and cooling systems, and electrical appliances to enable families to lower energy usage. From 1976, WAP allowed annual energy savings of $372 on average to 7 million homes. Annually, WAP is supporting 35,000 homes on average. WAP supports $4,695 per unit on average. It is part of the 2050 net-zero goal.
WAP funding is provided by the Department of Energy (DOE), which depends on the annual congressional appropriation. There is also non-DOE funding such as $3.16 billion approved by Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (Infrastructure Investment and Job Act). It is a one-off payment provided to remain until expended. It shows increased importance given to energy issues in the Biden government. Not only the budget from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but annual congressional appropriation is also increasing rapidly. For example, $290m in FY2019 to $33m in FY2020.
According to National Evaluation, WAP returns energy benefits of $1.72 and non-energy benefits of $2.78 for every $1 invested. These non-energy benefits include medical expenses saved or increased productivity at work.
